Caching is a technique used to improve the performance and efficiency of software systems by storing copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (called a cache). When a request for data is made, the system first checks the cache before accessing the slower, primary data source. If the data is available in the cache, it can be retrieved more quickly, reducing latency and load on the primary data source.
